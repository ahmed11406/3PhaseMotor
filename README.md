# 3PhaseMotor
This MATLAB script takes the AC induction motor parameters plus the supply voltage as inputs and calculates the developed torque associated with rotor speed at each point during changing the supply voltage, external stator resistance or the V/F ratio. 

After calculation, the script plots the resulting characteristic curves. Both types of Squirel-Cage and Wound rotor types are used.
